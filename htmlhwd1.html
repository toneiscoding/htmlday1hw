    <p><h2><strong> MY WHY</strong></h2></p>
    <p>I have chosen my why to finish this bootcamp and to  start <strong>my journey</strong> in the tech industry</p> 
    <h3>Mi Familia</h3>
    <ol>For my <strong>family</strong>; coming from a low income family this will help tremendously, not just financially and will give a peace of mind to my family so they do not have to worry about me, nor do they have to worry about things that money can buy.  They say money cannot buy happiness, but it definitely  can make life easier.  You see and hear about people in the industry creating generational wealth with their hands in tech companies, such as stock options and patenting softwares to get residual income or royalties from their inventions.  I believe it will give the next generations in my family to have someone to look up to and easily say to themselves, "Tony did it why can't I."</ol><br>
    <h3>To Better Myself</h3>
    <ol>I think this will hellp myself in the <strong>long run  as well</strong>, Per Scholas has so many alumni and their curriculum helps you be prepared to use your hard skills in the work place while also preparing you to use the soft skills for networking, interviews and job application process.  Some things that I have been needing to work on for myself is getting over the fear of reaching out to my network and catching up with people I have not spoken to in years.  It would be great to catch up with these people and I hope they will feel the same way.  Coding has helped me understand and put to work a Growth Mindset, in which I have come to understand mistakes do happen and with a little effort and time they can be corrected.  I believe if a child is interested in technology they should learn how to code and it should be implemented into our school systems.</ol><br>
    <ol>I am determined to find my niche into tech.  I believe this program is a great base for that foundation I needed to gain some weight  into the industry.  The certificate will help solidify that.  Of course I could have done the self taught way but Per Scholas has a proven track record.  Working in person with people just feels normal again and we've all needed some normalcy. I know joining this group will be beneficial to make the right connections.  Plus this group is so helpful and so is the staff.  Everyone has been just wanting everyone else to succeed and do well.  Hella grateful.  I believe one day when I get through and find my niche, I will give back to my community.  I learned in my network that there are no one who is a software enigineer or anyone who is into the tech industry.  I want to bridge the gap like those who have come before me. </ol><br>
